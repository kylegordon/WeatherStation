Using OpenWRT on Bifferboard to find out what the weather is like.

Why can't I just look out the window?

So here's the script. I have a Bifferboard, some USB wireless network devices, a W-8681 weather station, and a desire to capture the data remotely.

BIFFBOOT CONFIG
===============
Configuration values:
bootsource:  on-board flash
console:     enabled
nic:         enabled
boottype:    Linux 2.6 parameter block
loadaddress: 0x00400000
cmndline:    rootfstype=squashfs,jffs2 console=uart,io,0x3f8 init=/etc/preinit ubi.mtd=rootfs <-- remove the console parameter if using homebuilt OpenWRT
kernelmax:   0x0010

kmod-carl9170 for Netgear stick
kmod-rt2800-usb for Ralink

BASIC SETUP
===========
If using the standard Biff image from http://sites.google.com/site/bifferboard/Home/factory-firmware then note the contents of http://sites.google.com/site/bifferboard/Home/howto/install-opkg-files

opkg update
opkg install bash vim # Retain some sanity

Use 'passwd' to set a root password. This will disable telnet and automatically enable the dropbear SSH daemon.

uci set system.cfg1.hostname=weather1
uci commit

WIRELESS
========

For this task I was using a Ralink RT2870 USB device. This is normally supported by the kmod-rt2800-usb module.
 In my case, as I was building the firmware from scratch, I enabled it during the build process. It's hidden in the Kernel Modules > Wireless subsection. Enable it as a kernel builtin, as making it a module just confuses m
atters.

opkg update
opkg install wpad-mini # Handles WPA2

Execute the following command to generate a default config
wifi detect > /etc/config/wireless

Edit /etc/config/wireless to contain the following
config wifi-device  radio0
        option type     mac80211
        option channel  11
        option macaddr  00:a1:b0:f2:14:da
        option hwmode   11ng
        option htmode   HT20
        list ht_capab   GF
        list ht_capab   SHORT-GI-20
        list ht_capab   SHORT-GI-40
        list ht_capab   RX-STBC1
                                          
config wifi-iface        
        option device   radio0
        option network  lan   
        option mode     sta   
        option ssid     Glasgownet       
        option encryption psk2 
        option key      always32

Execute 'wifi' to bring up the network

uci show wireless should also show the same settings.

AUTOMATIC WIRELESS
==================
I couldn't be bothered finding out why wireless wasn't automatically coming up at bootup, but I suspect it's due to the USB devices being detected long after the network scripts are run.

To work around this, I used the @reboot function of cron. Use of cron was already on the cards, so it's no extra work.

touch /etc/crontabs/root
ln -sf /etc/crontabs/root /etc/crontab # For convenience
Execute 'crontab -e' and place the following line in it

@reboot sleep 60 ; /sbin/wifi

I tested it without the sleep 60, and it seemed to work. However, I'd rather be slow and confident rather than  focus on speed. Better to let the system settle down for a minute before trying to bring up the interface.

Reboot to test, and be happy.

TIME
====
Bifferboard has no RTC, so an external time source is vital. However, as the network isn't up immediately, the inbuilt rdate app fails to find anything. Easiest route around that is to install ntpclient and leave it to poll in the background. Once installed it will automatically use the uci configuration data for timeservers.

uci show timeserver
opkg update
opkg install ntpclient

VPN NETWORKING
==============
I have a VPN network in which to keep in touch with all my remote devices, be they phones, cars, weather stations, etc. As this weather station is going to be installed in a remote location behind a NAT router, by hooking it into the VPN I can access it remotely without having to worry about firewall tunnelling and other nastiness.

opkg update
opkg install openvpn

Setting up OpenVPN is left as an excercise for the reader. You should just need a client configuration, 2 certificates, and keyfile.

GETTING DATA
============
Install fowsr on the Bifferboard, and periodically upload to server for processing
opkg update
opkg install fowsr
